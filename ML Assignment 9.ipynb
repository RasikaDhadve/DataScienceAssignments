Explain the various aspects of feature engineering in depth.\nFeature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning. In order to make machine learning work well on new tasks, it might be necessary to design and train better features.\nFeature engineering in ML consists of four main steps: Feature Creation, Transformations, Feature Extraction, and Feature Selection. Feature engineering consists of creation, transformation, extraction, and selection of features, also known as variables, that are most conducive to creating an accurate ML algorithm.\nLets take a look at some Feature Engineering Types:\nImputation: Imputation deals with handling missing values in data.\nDiscretization/Binning: Discretization involves essentially taking a set of values of data and grouping sets of them together in some logical fashion into bins (or buckets).\nCategorical Encoding: Categorical encoding is the technique used to encode categorical features into numerical values which are usually simpler for an algorithm to understand. One hot encoding (OHE) is a popularly used technique of categorical encoding. Here, categorical values are converted into simple numerical 1’s and 0’s without the loss of information.\nFeature Splitting: Splitting features into parts can sometimes improve the value of the features toward the target to be learned. For instance, Date might better contribute to the target function than Date and Time.\nHandling Outliers: Outliers are unusually high or low values in the dataset which are unlikely to occur in normal scenarios. Since these outliers could adversely affect your prediction, they must be handled appropriately.\n",

What are the various methods of function selection?\nFeature Selection is the process where you automatically or manually select those features which contribute most to your prediction variable or output in which you are interested in. Having irrelevant features in your data can decrease the accuracy of the models and make your model learn based on irrelevant features.\nThere are three types of feature selection:\nWrapper methods (forward, backward, and stepwise selection)\nFilter methods (ANOVA, Pearson correlation, variance thresholding)\nEmbedded methods (Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree).\n",

What are the most widely used function extraction algorithms?\nFeature selection is the process of reducing the number of input variables when developing a predictive model. It is desirable to reduce the number of input variables to both reduce the computational cost of modelling and, in some cases, to improve the performance of the model. There are three types of feature selection:\nWrapper methods (forward, backward, and stepwise selection): In wrapper methods, we try to use a subset of features and train a model using them. Based on the inferences that we draw from the previous model; we decide to add or remove features from your subset. The problem is essentially reduced to a search problem. These methods are usually computationally very expensive.\nFilter methods (ANOVA, Pearson correlation, variance thresholding): Filter methods are generally used as a preprocessing step. The selection of features is independent of any machine learning algorithms. Instead, features are selected on the basis of their scores in various statistical tests for their correlation with the outcome variable. The correlation is a subjective term here.\nEmbedded methods (Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree): Embedded methods combine the qualities of filter and wrapper methods. It’s implemented by algorithms that have their own built-in feature selection methods. Some of the most popular examples of these methods are LASSO and RIDGE regression which have inbuilt penalization functions to reduce overfitting. Lasso regression performs L1 regularization which adds penalty equivalent to absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. Ridge regression performs L2 regularization which adds penalty equivalent to square of the magnitude of coefficients.\n",

Describe the feature engineering process in the sense of a text categorization issue.\nText classification is the problem of assigning categories to text data according to its content. The most important part of text classification is feature engineering: the process of creating features for a machine learning model from raw text data. Example: Text cleaning steps vary according to the type of data and the required task. Generally, the string is converted to lowercase and punctuation is removed before text gets tokenized. Tokenization is the process of splitting a string into a list of strings (or “tokens”). We can create a list of generic stop words for the English vocabulary with NLTK (the Natural Language Toolkit), which is a suite of libraries and programs for symbolic and statistical natural language processing. Then we can remove these stop words. We need to be very careful with stop words because if you remove the wrong token you may lose important information. For example, the word “will” was removed and we lost the information that the person is Will Smith. With this in mind, it can be useful to do some manual modification to the raw text before removing stop words (for example, replacing “Will Smith” with “Will_Smith”). Stemming and Lemmatization both generate the root form of words. The difference is that stem might not be an actual word whereas lemma is an actual language word (also stemming is usually faster). Those algorithms are both provided by NLTK.\n\n",

The cosine similarity is advantageous because even if the two similar documents are far apart by the Euclidean distance (due to the size of the document), chances are they may still be oriented closer together.\nCosine similarity is the cosine of the angle between two n-dimensional vectors in an n-dimensional space. It is the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of the two vectors' lengths (or magnitudes).\nThe formula for calculating the cosine similarity is : Cos(x, y) = x . y / ||x|| * ||y||\nIn our Question cos(x,y) = 23/(root 40 * root 29) = 0.675\n\n",

The technique is widely used to emphasize variation and capture strong patterns in a data set.\nVectors can be used to represent physical quantities.
